# Reflection - Git and GitHub Learning Experience
In this assignment, I learned how to use both Git and GitHub, as well as putting hands-on for JavaScript. I was a bit nervous when I started because I'm still trying to 
switch myself on and off from writing Python and switching to JavaScript. The biggest confusing part about this assignment is getting through to write the functions in 
the terminal. After researching a little further on my own, I figured nano out, and felt like I had unlocked my biggest obstacle yet. Afterwards, I was able to input my 
functions, as well as how, by reviewing old notes from previous classes. I believe developers use Git because it provides version control and allows to track progress, 
fix mistakes, and collaborate with others to work on projects without overwriting any work. Having a clear commit history would make it easy to understand what and why 
changes were made. This would be a helpful experience for larger projects because it would teach disciplined coding habits. Personally, I find this as a very important 
tool to use so that developers could review each other's work while maintaing everything organized and recoverable.
